# Start development server (if not running)
npm run dev

# Open dashboard in browser
open http://localhost:3004
```

### **Step 2: Feature Development Process** 🛠️

#### **A. Choose Your Next Feature**
Pick from these priorities based on real business data:

1. **Lead Management** (14 real leads available)
   - Lead processing automation
   - Lead scoring system
   - Conversion tracking

2. **Employee Dashboard** (45 employees across 6 branches)
   - Employee performance metrics
   - Department analytics
   - Branch management

3. **Client Communication** (67 WhatsApp messages + Instagram data)
   - Communication timeline
   - Automated responses
   - Message analytics

4. **AI Features** (145 call transcriptions + AI configs)
   - Call analysis dashboard
   - AI-powered insights
   - Automated task generation

#### **B. Development Steps for Each Feature**
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch (optional but recommended)
git checkout -b feature/lead-management

# 2. Create new page/component
# Example: app/leads/page.tsx

# 3. Create API endpoint if needed
# Example: app/api/leads/route.ts

# 4. Test with real data
# Your database has real leads, employees, etc.

# 5. Backup your work
npm run db:backup
```

### **Step 3: Working with Real Data** 📊

#### **Available Real Data Tables**
```bash
# View all your data
node scripts/simple-db-viewer.js

# Key tables with data:
# - companies (4 rows)
# - branches (6 rows) 
# - employees (45 rows)
# - leads (14 rows)
# - quotations (4 rows)
# - whatsapp_messages (67 rows)
# - call_transcriptions (145 rows)
# - events (215 rows)
```

#### **Database Query Examples**
```typescript
// In your React components or API routes
import { query } from '@/lib/db';

// Get real leads
const leads = await query('SELECT * FROM leads ORDER BY created_at DESC');

// Get employee by branch
const chennaiEmployees = await query(`
  SELECT e.*, b.name as branch_name 
  FROM employees e 
  JOIN employee_companies ec ON e.id = ec.employee_id
  JOIN branches b ON ec.branch_id = b.id 
  WHERE b.name = 'Chennai'
`);

// Get recent WhatsApp messages
const messages = await query(`
  SELECT * FROM whatsapp_messages 
  ORDER BY created_at DESC 
  LIMIT 10
`);
```

### **Step 5: Development Best Practices** ✨

#### **Data Management**
```bash
# Sync latest production data (weekly)
npm run db:populate

# Backup before major changes
npm run db:backup

# Reset if needed
npm run db:reset
```

#### **Code Organization**
```
app/
├── leads/              # Lead management
├── employees/          # Employee management  
├── communications/     # Communication hub
├── ai/                # AI features
├── api/               # API endpoints
└── components/        # Shared components
```

#### **Testing with Real Data**
- Always test with actual business scenarios
- Use real employee names and departments
- Test with actual lead data and quotations
- Validate with real communication patterns

### **Step 6: Feature Development Templates** 📝

#### **New Page Template**
```typescript
// app/[feature]/page.tsx
import { query } from '@/lib/db';
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from '@/components/ui/card';

async function getFeatureData() {
  const data = await query('SELECT * FROM your_table');
  return data.rows;
}

export default async function FeaturePage() {
  const data = await getFeatureData();
  
  return (
    <div className="p-6">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Feature Name</h1>
      {/* Your feature UI */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### **API Route Template**
```typescript
// app/api/[feature]/route.ts
import { query } from '@/lib/db';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function GET() {
  try {
    const result = await query('SELECT * FROM your_table');
    return NextResponse.json(result.rows);
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Database error' }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```
